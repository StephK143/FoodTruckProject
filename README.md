#What I learned

Continuing with learning Java as a language, how to use Eclipse, GitHub, Git and Terminal command line. In this project I used methods, getters and setters, arrays, abstraction and encapsulation of OOP. 

My light bulb moment was instantiation of objects. Not just the how but the why and what the implications of it all are. 

The biggest error I made was a simple one but one that wasn't obvious. I initialized an int and assigned it to 1 instead of 0 and then later when I assigned that int a value of 0 in the beginning of a method it led to a null pointer exception. I hope to never make that mistake again.
